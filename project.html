            <h2><span style="color:black"></span>Aims</h2>
            <p>The aim of my project is to determine the long term viability of cryptocurrency within society.<br>
           As cryptocurrency gains increased recognition, it is essential to examine whether or not there is evidence to support its sustained use in the future.</p>
            <h2><span style="color: black"></span>Data</h2>
            <p>For my project, I have collected & scraped data from a range of sources, including www.cbdctracker.com & www.tripleai.com.<br> The csv files utilised for my charts are also available on my Github.<br>
             In addition, I employed the machine learning technique of cosine similarity to compare the similarity between Bitcoin & the DotCom bubble.</p>
            <h2><span style="color:black"></span>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>One challenge I encountered during my project was figuring out how to extract data from a table with multiple pages. To overcome this, I copied the HTML of each page and input it into Colab.<br>
            Afterwards, I cleaned the data from each table seperately and used a function in Colab to merge into a larger CSV.<br>
            Another issue I encountered was that Vega was not reading my data when creating maps. To resolve this, I manually edited the data within the raw files to match the GeoJson.</p>

                   The data shows no correlation between GDP per capita and crypto currency adoption worldwide, indicating the use of cryptocurrency is not limited to high GDP countries.<br>
                   This data suggests that cryptocurrency has strong potential for future use worldwide and is not restricted to specific socio-economic groups. </p>

        <h3>Cryptocurrency Market Cap</h3>

        <P>The pie chart illustrates the market share of the top cryptocurrencies. As shown, Bitcoin has the largest market cap by a significant margin.<br>
            For this reason, in my analysis I will use Bitcoin as a representative of cryptocurrency. Using the overall market cap would not reflect <br>
            the potential of cryptocurrency because it includes a large number of "meme coins" with no long term potential, which would distort my analysis. </p>

            The adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is a strong indicator of the potential future of cryptocurrency, as the acceptance of cryptocurrency by governments and financial institutions is crucial for its long-term viability in financial markets.<br>
            The map shows that a large number of countries are working on creating a CBDC, which bodes well for the future of cryptocurrency<br> </p>

            <h2>Trust & Security</h2>
            <p>One of the main factors hindering the growth of cryptocurrency is the lack of trust among users.<br>
            The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency also exposes users to a higher risk of fraud and hacking, as there is limited government oversight in the industry.<br>
            The charts below show the top 10 largest scams in 2020 and a visual correlation between searches expressing doubt about cryptocurrency and BTC price movements.</p>

        <h2>Is it a Bubble</h2>
        <p>The title of the graph is hyperlinked to my colab sheet<br>
        One common critique of cryptocurrency is that it is a bubble & will eventually lose popularity. Using the cosine similarity technique, I found that the price action of cryptocurrency has a 92% similarity to the Dot Com bubble.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> In conclusion, my research and analysis I have undertaken suggests that cryptocurrency does have a future. Although the price action of cryptocurrency has a high similarity to the DotCom bubble, it is worth noting that several successful companies, such as Amazon, were also a part of the DotCom bubble<br> 
            As a matter of fact, the bursting of the bubble may ultimately benefit cryptocurrency by eliminating coins without viable use cases or that are scams, in a similar manner to how the DotCom bubble exposed and eliminated inefficient companies, consequently resulting in increased trust in cryptocurrency. <br>
            However, to solidify the future of cryptocurrency, I believe it will need more regulation and oversight, which may come as a result of events like the FTX scandal. With the combination of these factors and continued government adoption of digital currency, I believe cryptocurrency has a bright future.<br>
            Further research could examine the impact of regulation on the cryptocurrency market and compare the adoption process of fiat currency and cryptocurrency to understand how widescale adoption may occur.</p>
